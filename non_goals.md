# Non-Goals

This project intentionally does NOT attempt to:

- Diagnose root causes of failures
- Predict or prevent faults
- Optimize startup times
- Hide uncertainty from the user
- Maintain system operation at all costs
- Apply AI, heuristics, or probabilistic reasoning
- Adapt behavior based on historical data
- Perform hardware-level protection logic

Uncertainty is not resolved — it is respected.

If confirmation cannot be obtained,
the system stops.
